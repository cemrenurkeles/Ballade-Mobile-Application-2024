# Steps of my work from April 25th to April 28th

## Task: Adding missing songs ##

The song names are converted into a C list to be used in the program with ChatGPT.

A C program is developed to compare them. Commas are added at the end of the found songs to distinguish them from others, and an Excel sheet is used to identify the location of missing songs.

Code is initiated to add them, revealing another issue: When adding a new song, it's observed that the identifiers are not automatically updated, disrupting the alphabetical order.

Efforts are made to solve this issue, leading to the discovery of problems within the database.

**On April 28th, the idea of creating a new database is proposed by me.**
